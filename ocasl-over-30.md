This spring, we’re teaming up with [Orange County Adult Soccer League (OCASL)](http://www.ocasl.org) to expand over-30 adult soccer to Durham. We’ll be playing some games at Campus Hills Park in Durham, in addition to playing games at Soccer.com Center, a top-quality public facility in Efland.

Each team will play one game a week in either Durham or Efland. Durham games are on Tuesdays, Efland games are on Wednesdays. All games kick off at 7:30 p.m.

The first games are on Wednesday, March 25 in Efland.

We play on 70-yard fields, 8 v.8, with goalkeepers and no offside and no slide tackling. Unlimited substitutions. Shinguards are required.

Each game is officiated by a certified referee.

The cost is $40. If you’re a captain who can register the majority of your own team, you play free.

      <h4 id="location">Location</h4>
      <p>Our games will be played outdoors at <strong>Sherwood Park</strong> in east Durham. The park features a full-size, lighted 42-meter futsal pitch. Although the surface is in not in great condition, it's playable. Durham Parks and Rec will be replacing it in the fall.</p>

      <p>If there are thunderstorms or extreme heat in the forecast, we will move the games to the gym of <strong>Githens Middle School</strong> in southwest Durham. We will check the weather on the morning of each match day. If a relocation to Githens is advisable, we will announce it by email to team captains, and via <a href="https://www.facebook.com/durhamatletico?ref=hl">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DurhamAtletico">Twitter</a> and, in some cases, SMS.</p>

      <h5>Directions</h5>

      <p>Sherwood Park is located at 1720 Cheek Road, at the end of an unmarked driveway between Geer Street and US 70. <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fmaps%2Fplace%2FSherwood%2BPark%2F%4036.0001122%2C-78.8728104%2C16z%2Fdata%3D!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x89ace49b561177fb%3A0x3041e1da79e960cd">Map</a>.</p>

      <p>Githens Middle School’s address is 4800 Old Chapel Hill Road, but you’ll want to use the entrance on SW Durham Drive (it’s the same entrance that’s used for Old Chapel Hill Road Park). <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fmaps%2Fplace%2FSherwood%2BGithens%2BMiddle%2BSchool%2F%4035.944403%2C-78.979803%2C16z%2Fdata%3D!4m2!3m1!1s0x0%3A0x9e53889ae5ecc2f5">Map</a>.</p>

        <h4 id="about-futsal">About Futsal</h4>
        <p>Futsal is a form of 5 v. 5 soccer, with goalkeepers.</p>

        <p>It is similar to the conventional indoor soccer that Americans are used to, except that the ball is smaller and less bouncy, and there's no kicking of balls off walls. As result, the emphasis is on control and footwork.</p>

        <p>The game was invented in Uruguay in the 1930s, and it's one of the reasons South America produces so many technically brilliant players. (Google "Ronaldinho + futsal!")</p>

        <p>Among the key differences between futsal and normal soccer, indoor or outdoor:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Instead of throw-ins, balls are played in with a kick-in.</li>
        <li>Substitutions are unlimited, and they can take place during the flow of the game, as with hockey.</li>
        <li>No slide tackles or shoulder charges.</li>
        <li>Each half will be 25 minutes long, with no stoppages.</li>
        <li>Keepers have four seconds to release the ball.</li>
        <li>Keepers may receive only one back pass per possession (and may not pick up a back pass).</li>
        <li>No offside!</li>
        </ul>

<p>These are the key differences, but mostly, it's just soccer!</p>

        <h4 id="faq">FAQ</h4>
        <h5>Do you have insurance?</h5>
        <p>We do not have medical, only the general liability that is required by Durham Parks and Rec. We will need waivers signed.</p>

        <h5>I don't have a team. How do I play?</h5>
        <p>That's easy! Just register as a free agent.</p>

        <h5>I'd like to play, but the cost is prohibitive.</h5>
        <p>We don't want to turn anyone away for lack of funds. If this is an issue, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@durhamatletico.com">info@durhamatletico.com</a>.</p>

        <h5>Is Durham Atletico a nonprofit?</h5>
        <p>Technically, no. We are a limited liability company. However, this company is not designed to be profitable, but to further social goals. For more, visit <a href="/about">About</a>.</p>

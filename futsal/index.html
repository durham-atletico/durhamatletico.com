      <h4 id="winter-futsal-league">Winter Futsal League 2015</h4>
      <p>It's our pleasure to announce that Durham Atlético's Winter Futsal League is officially open, and we invite you to join us on Tuesday nights beginning Feb. 3!</p>
      <p>We have room for six teams, and four have already been filled. This will be a great opportunity to try out the game that nurtured so many great South American talents, although we can't promise you'll be dribbling like Ronaldinho after playing with us.</p>
      <p>This will be a lot of fun, and we hope you'll join us. We are using Durham Atlético as a springboard to push for better soccer facilities in Durham. Money we earn from this league, and future ones like it, will go toward improving Durham's public soccer facilities. The shortage of fields in Durham affects low-income and working class communities most acutely.</p>
      <p>We are joined by generous and enthusiastic sponsors including Bull McCabe's, Mattie B's and Motorco. They've contributed their support because they love soccer, and of course, their establishments will be great places for us to celebrate our victories (or lament our defeats).</p>
      <p>The price is $90 per person. Some of you may be making payment arrangements with your team sponsors, but "free agents should pay here.</p>

        <p>We have budgeted this league for $90 a player. This will <a href="/transparency">allow us to pay our expenses and purchase goals</a> we need in the spring. However, we don't want anyone to be turned away for lack of funds. If this is an issue, please pay what you can afford (contact us at <a href="mailto:info@durhamatletico.com">info@durhamatletico.com</a>). We'd prefer that you pay via PayPal, but you can also pay with cash, check or credit card onsite at your first game.</p>

        <h4 id="rules">House Rules for Durham Atlético Winter Futsal League</h4>
        <h5>Structure of Play</h5>

        <ul>
            <li>Each half will be 25 minutes long, with no stoppages and no added time</li>

            <li>Each game will start promptly on the hour</li>

            <li>Each second half will start promptly at half past the hour</li>

            <ul>
                <li>if the game starts late, for any reason, the first half will last for 25 minutes, but the lost time will be deducted from the halftime period</li>
                <li>if this occurs, the referee will notify the teams after the conclusion of the first half that halftime has been shortened</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Each game will end at five minutes before the hour.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Rules of Play</h5>

        <p>Futsal is played 5 v. 5, with goalkeepers.</p> <p>In general, what is considered a foul in conventional soccer is a foul in futsal, with the following important exceptions:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>In futsal, there is no slide tackling</li>
            <li>In futsal, there are no shoulder charges</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We will follow most of the <a href="http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/51/44/50/futsallawsofthegameen.pdf">FIFA futsal laws</a>. The key ones follow:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>There are no offside rules</li>
        <li>Unlimited substitutions</li>
        <li>Substitutions occur during open play (i.e. like hockey)</li>
        <li>It is not necessary to solicit the referee’s permission to substitute players, but departing players must be off the court before their replacements take the court</li>
        <li>Balls played out of bounds will be played in with a kick, not a throw-in</li>
        <li>The team kicking the ball in has four seconds to do it.</li>
        <li>Goalkeepers may receive only one back pass per possession</li>
        <li>Goalkeepers handling the ball must release it within four seconds</li>
        <li>Fouls in the penalty area will result in a penalty kick given at the first penalty spot, located at the top of the penalty area approximately 6 meters from the goal</li>
        <li>The referee will keep track of fouls. When a team has suffered five fouls in a half, each subsequent foul will result in a penalty kick taken from the second penalty spot, located approximately 10 meters from the goal. (At Weaver Street, this spot is at half court.)</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Head Injuries</h5>

    <p>We will do our best to ensure a safe playing environment. In the unfortunate event that there is a head injury, the following policy is required by our insurer, and by common sense:</p>

    <p>If a player suffers a head injury that leads the referee to believe the player may have been concussed, the player will be removed from the game until its conclusion.</p>
    <p>The referee may choose to consult with both team captains about the severity of the injury, but his or her decision about the player's fitness is final.</p>
    <p>If it has been necessary to remove a player, the referee will note the incident and the player's identity on the match report.</p>
    <p>Before returning to play in subsequent weeks, the player must produce written clearance from a licensed physician.</p>
    <p>We hope no one is injured playing in the Durham Atlético futsal league. However, injuries do occur, and this policy will be strictly enforced.</p>

    <h5>Discipline</h5>
    <p>As with conventional soccer, the referees will indicate cautions with yellow cards.</p>

    <p>Likewise, referees will utilize red cards to eject repeat offenders or players guilty of flagrant fouls, dangerous play or abusive behavior.</p>

    <p>Any player receiving a red card will be suspended for one game.</p>

    <p>Fighting and abusive language will not be tolerated. Referees will take appropriate action in such instances, and they will note the incidents on their match reports.</p>

    <p>Incidents of this nature will be reviewed by a disciplinary committee consisting of David Fellerath and Kosta Harlan, the two principals of Durham Atlético, and a neutral captain.</p>

    <p>In the event that the incident occurred in a game involving the Durham All-Stars (David and Kosta’s team), the incident will be reviewed by three neutral captains.</p>

    <p>Sanctions may include suspension from play and expulsion from the league for the duration of the season.</p>

    <h5>Statistics</h5>
    <p>We will keep an up-to-date league table on the Durham Atlético website.</p>

    <p>We would also like to track goals, but to do this we need your help.</p>
    <p>After each game, we would like the captains to email us the identities of their goal scorers</p>
    <p>If this system works, we will be able to keep a tally of the league’s leading scorers.</p>

      <h4 id="location">Location</h4>
      <p>The location will be <a href="https://www.durhamnc.gov/gis_apps/parkapp/park.cfm?selVal=park&ParkNam=Weaver+Street+Park">Weaver Street Recreation Center</a> in south Durham.</p><p>This is a basketball court, so please wear appropriate shoes.</p>

        <h4 id="about-futsal">About Futsal</h4>
        <p>Futsal is a form of 5 v. 5 soccer, with goalkeepers.</p>

        <p>It is similar to the conventional indoor soccer that Americans are used to, except that the ball is smaller and less bouncy, and there's no kicking of balls off walls. As result, the emphasis is on control and footwork.</p>

        <p>The game was invented in Uruguay in the 1930s, and it's one of the reasons South America produces so many technically brilliant players. (Google "Ronaldinho + futsal!)</p>

        <p>We will play on a small basketball court at Weaver Street Recreation Center, where we will have experienced, certified referees to ensure that the game's unique rules are followed.</p>

        <p>Among the key differences between futsal and normal soccer, indoor or outdoor:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Instead of throw-ins, balls are played in with a kick-in.</li>
        <li>Substitutions are unlimited, and they can take place during the flow of the game, as with hockey.</li>
        <li>No slide tackles or shoulder charges.</li>
        <li>Each half will be 25 minutes long, with no stoppages.</li>
        <li>Keepers have four seconds to release the ball.</li>
        <li>Keepers may receive only one back pass per possession (and may not pick up a back pass).</li>
        <li>No offside!</li>
        </ul>

<p>These are the key differences, but mostly, it's just soccer!</p>

        <h4 id="faq">FAQ</h4>
        <h5>Do you have insurance?</h5>
        <p>We do not have medical, only the general liability that is required by Durham Parks and Rec. We will need waivers signed.</p>

        <h5>I don't have a team. How do I play?</h5>
        <p>That's easy! Just register as a free agent.</p>

        <h5>I'd like to play, but the cost is prohibitive.</h5>
        <p>We don't want to turn anyone away for lack of funds. If this is an issue, please contact us at info@durhamatletico.com.</p>

        <h5>Is Durham Atletico a nonprofit?</h5>
        <p>Technically, no. We are a limited liability company. However, this company is not designed to be profitable, but to further social goals. For more, visit <a href="/about">About</a>.</p>

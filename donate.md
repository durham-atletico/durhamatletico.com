## Why we're raising funds

Durham Atlético was founded in January 2015 as a means of addressing a critical shortage of soccer facilities in Durham, as well as a way to organize adult soccer and futsal.

We began a winter futsal league this year, which has six teams and 60 players. One of our objectives was to raise money to purchase youth soccer goals to be placed at Campus Hills Park, a multi-use field in South Durham, near the campus of North Carolina Central University. These goals would be available for children and adults alike.

A single 18x6 youth goal costs about **$1,650**. We are hoping to purchase two of them, but we need your help.

At Durham Atlético, LLC, we are committed to finding practical solutions to the problems of soccer access in urban and lower-income communities. This effort to place goals at Campus Hills Park will create options for youth soccer groups in central and southern Durham.

We are not a nonprofit--although we may become one in the future--so your gift is not tax-deductible. Give today!

After the conclusion of our final games on Tuesday, we’re going to celebrate the end of our first season of adult futsal by having a get-together at [Motorco’s GarageBar](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fmotorcomusic.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHZgEfHlPmE0PwIo7hnWbPbK6MHDQ), located at [723 Rigsbee Ave](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoo.gl%2Fmaps%2FtxBGb), in Durham’s Central Park district. 

The final night is going to be a lot of fun: No fewer than three teams are in a position to win the cup—and yes, there will be "silverware." 

We’re very pleased to announce, too, that we will have a parting gift to the players who showed such faith in our ability to organize this league. Here’s a hint—if you wear S, XL or XXL, we only have a few, so make your reservations now.

It’s forecast to be a lovely evening on Tuesday, so bring your friends, partners and dogs to the games. Afterward, repair to GarageBar, where festivities will start at 9:15 PM or so. The last game of the season is at 8pm. We’ll head to the bar straight afterward, where we’ll make a few announcements, hand out Best V and Second-best V awards, and present the winning team with the championship trophy.

We know it’s a school night, and some of you have long trips home to Raleigh or Chapel Hill, so we will get all this done by 9:45. Maybe even 9:30! In the meantime, be sure to tip your bartender.

The standings look like this:

|Team|Pts|W|L|D|GF|GA|GD|
|:---|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
|Mattie B's|21|7|2|0|98|75|23|
|Motorco FC|19|6|2|1|76|52|24|
|Bull McCabe's|18|6|3|0|58|46|12|
|Freelancers United|15|5|4|0|90|79|11|
|Durham All Stars|5|1|6|2|64|91|-27|
|Market Failure|1|0|8|1|58|101|-43|

See you Tuesday!

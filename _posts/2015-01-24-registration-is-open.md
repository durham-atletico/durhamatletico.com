It's our pleasure to announce that [registration for Durham Atlético's Winter Futsal League](/futsal#register) is officially open, and we invite you to join us on Tuesday nights beginning Feb. 3!

We have room for six teams, and about four have already been filled. This will be a great opportunity to try out the game that nurtured so many great South American talents, although we can't promise you'll be dribbling like Ronaldinho after playing with us.

This will be a lot of fun, and we hope you'll join us. We want to stress that we are using Durham Atlético as a springboard to push for better soccer facilities in Durham. Money we earn from this league, and future ones like it, will go toward improving Durham's public soccer facilities.

We are joined by generous and enthusiastic sponsors including Bull McCabe's, Mattie B's and Motorco. They've contributed their support because they love soccer, and of course, they'd love it if we'd come hang out with them after games.

If you're interested to play, please [register now](/futsal.html#register) because space will fill up very quickly!

## Futsal... with a little help from our friends

We’re nearing the end of our first season of adult futsal, and it’s hard to believe how far we’ve come since the day Kosta and I decided, via Gchat, to see if we could get something like this off the ground.

Now, after nine weeks of play, and two weeks missed due to snow, we’re closing in on Week 10. And an exciting finale it will be, with no fewer than [four teams in contention for the title](/futsal/schedule). And yes, there will be a trophy!

There are so many people to thank for getting us to this point, from the first conversation with Malachy Noone of Bull McCabe’s to the enthusiastic commitments shortly thereafter from Josh Wittman of Motorco and Matthew Beason of Mattie B’s.

We began Durham Atletico with a twofold mission: to create new opportunities to play organized soccer in a town with a shortage of available space, and to raise funds to purchase two outdoor youth goals for the field at Campus Hills Park. We achieved these goals through the incredible generosity of players who were willing to pay $90 each, and of the extra support of Bull McCabe’s, Mattie B’s and Motorco.

We purchased the goals, valued at $2,550, and installed them at Campus Hills last month. In June, we will formally donate them to Durham Parks and Rec. A couple of weeks ago, Bonitta Best of the Durham News [wrote a nice column about us, and this effort](http://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/community/durham-news/dn-sports/article17861792.html).

Tammy Brown and Brandon Reed of Durham Parks and Rec were vitally helpful in securing us a place to play, at the height of basketball season. Without the space at Weaver Street Recreation Center, we would not have gotten started. 

We’ve subsequently moved on to larger spaces--for Lucas Middle School, we have to thank Tom Johnson and John Dietz of NJAA, and Michelle Brossette of Durham Public Schools. For Sherwood Park, Cathy Baldwin of DPR (with a special shoutout for letting us play before the re-paving of the parking lot was completely finished). 

A special debt of gratitude is owed to John Dietz for hauling the goals around in his truck these last few weeks as we’ve wandered between Lucas and Sherwood.

We’ve got some exciting announcements coming up, including news about our summer league, which we’ll post soon. 

Until then, see you on the pitch.

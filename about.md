Launched in January 2015, Durham Atlético is a soccer organization dedicated to broadening access to the beautiful game throughout Durham, with a particular focus on the urban core.

We are committed to tackling two intertwined challenges: the lack of available public soccer fields in Durham, and the scarcity of low-cost, structured programs for children and adults. We are also committed to improving soccer facilities for low-wealth, immigrant and minority communities.

In the winter and spring of 2015, Durham Atlético is focused on two primary objectives.

- To organize and run an adult indoor futsal league. Futsal is an increasingly popular type of soccer invented in South America
- To raise money to buy the goals and nets needed to upgrade an existing athletic field to make it suitable for youth and adult soccer.

Durham Atlético is a limited liability company. The managing member is longtime Durham resident David Fellerath. As we achieve our preliminary goals and develop a business model, we will identify and transition to a corporate structure that is best suited for our long-term success.

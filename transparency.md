We chose to incorporate Durham Atlético as a limited liability company because it was the simplest, most economical way to get started on our goals here in Durham. However, we are operating Durham Atlético as a community-oriented social enterprise, not as a profit-making venture.

We will not collect more money than we need to achieve our stated goals. In time, we may shift to a business structure that can tackle more complex objectives, but until then, our finances will be very simple.

If you're interested in looking at our current project budget, look for a link on this page (we'll put it up as soon as we can). Please address additional questions to info@durhamatletico.com

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Launched in January 2015, Durham Atlético is a soccer organization dedicated to broadening access to the beautiful game throughout Durham, with a particular focus on the urban core. </p>

<p>We are committed to tackling two intertwined challenges: the lack of available public soccer fields in Durham, and the scarcity of low-cost, structured programs for children and adults. We are also committed to improving soccer facilities for low-wealth, immigrant and minority communities.</p>

<p>In the winter and spring of 2015, Durham Atlético is focused on two primary objectives.</p>

<ul>
  <li>To organize and run an adult indoor futsal league. Futsal is an increasingly popular type of soccer invented in South America</li>
  <li>To raise money to buy the goals and nets needed to upgrade an existing athletic field to make it suitable for youth and adult soccer.</li>
</ul>

<p>Durham Atlético is a limited liability company. The managing member is longtime Durham resident David Fellerath. As we achieve our preliminary goals and develop a business model, we will identify and transition to a corporate structure that is best suited for our long-term success.</p>
